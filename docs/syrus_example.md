# Example Syrus Implementation

As Armor does not include any templates / views, and instead allows the [AdapterInterface Class](adapter.md) to handle rendering of templates, an example implementation utilizing the [Syrus template engine](https://github.com/apexpl/syrus) is available.  The Github repo for this example implementation is at:

You may also view an online demo fo this example at:  [https://armor.demo.apexpl.io/](https://armor.demo.apexpl.io/)

Please note, this example is NOT intended for production, and is purely for demonstration purposes.
